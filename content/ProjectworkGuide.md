# Projectwork Guide for: My first AKM Model

A Projectwork is a task or a series of tasks (an assignment) that you perform to create a product or a service.

In this Projectwork you will create an Active Knowledge Model (AKM) using the AKM Modeller.

## 1. Main tasks of a Projectwork

The main tasks in this Projectwork follows a modelling-project path, with Information gathering, Concept modelling , Model development.
Its based on the well tested methodologies like: DesignThinking, LEAN Startup and Agile Development.

The normal steps in a Modelling project are:

For more details see:
[Model Development Process](ModelDevelopmentProcess.md)

1. Explore the problem! (Design Thinking)  

    Concept selection identifies existing approaches, solutions and methodologies, then analyzes and tests them on the problem at hand, in order to reuse best practices and gain ideas for innovation.
    We are using Concept Modelling (Scaffolding) to create an overview model of the domain in focus, identifying the roles of users and stakeholders, the tasks they perform, and the information they apply or produce.
    Here we also define the Goals, Strategy, Methods and Outcome we or our customers want

2. Bilding the right Thing! Lean Startup (Scenario modeling)

   Lean Startup is about "Building the right thing" ie. find out what is most important, and which things to start with and the low hanging fruits.

    With Scenario modeling which provides more rich and detailed representations of important task patterns. In addition to role responsibilities and detailed information flows, the model at this stage should also represent the views, with information content and services (tasks) needed for performing the work.

3. Solutions modeling

    Solutions modeling specifies how a solution should function, integrating a number of scena- rios around a purposefully designed knowledge architecture, guided by the core concepts identified in the scaffolding model.

    Here we start building a Metamodel (Type definition model) of the product structure identified in the Concept model in previous steps. We add Properties to each EntiType (concept) and relationshipTypes between the EntityTypes.

4. Platform configuration

    Platform configuration maps the conceptual information, role, task and view models to the execution platform, defining how information is stored, access control is enforced, tasks should be executed, views presented in workplaces, etc
5. Platform delivery

    Platform delivery involved training users, but as well integrating existing application sys- tems and databases, applying e.g. model-configured data exchange, parameterizing APIs and web services.
6. Operation and improvement!

    Operation and improvement deals with the continued customization, adaptation and exten- sion of the solution to cover a wider scope, handle environmental changes, or reflect im- proved work practices.
