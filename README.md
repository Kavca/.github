## Welcome to KAVCA's  Active Knowledge Modellingüôå

***Active Knowledge Modelling*** (AKM) is a method for modelling and designing products, organizations, processes and systems. The method is based on the ***Active Knowledge Model*** (AKM) and the ***AKM Modeller***.  

***AKM Modeller*** is the tool for building ***Active Knowledge Models***, a modeling tool with integrated Use-case Modeling and Meta-modelling capabilities.

With the basic Metamodel constructs ***Information, Role, Task and View (IRTV)***, we can easily model any new product structures. The AKM Modeller can enhance the design and operation of Products, Organizations, Processes and Systems (POPS) by adding new concepts, properties, tasks,and work enhancing views.

üç™ Fun facts

The KAVCA Industrial Innovation projects go back to the AKM AS strategic planning project in 2007. The long-term visions and targets were Cyclic Design and Operation of product and process components supporting Holistic Design of projects, Roles and Workspaces and Collaboration Spaces. AKM AS was taken over by Commitment AS in 2008, but digitalization and web-based methods for desired platform solutions were still missing. Customer design and collaboration capabilities and cyclic design methods were still unsolved challenges. Web-based platform capabilities for networked collaboration were still a void.
